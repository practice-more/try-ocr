Running Tesseract

Tesseract is a command—line program, so ﬁrst open a terminal or command prompt. The command
is used like this:

tesseract imagename outputbase [—1 lang] [—psm pagesegmode] [configfile...]

So basic usage to do OCR on an image called 'myscan.png‘ and save the result to 'out.txt' would be:

tesseract myscan.png out
